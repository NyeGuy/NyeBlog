Around the time of these comics I was starting to seriously study game design. I was developing a prototype for a turned based combat game with toy animals. The captain class in the game were teddy bears. One of the sketches in their development slipped into my comic and decided he lived there. Recession Bear has become nyetoon's friend and council for a number of years now.  

I will never forget meeting my wife's cousins when we started dating. He turned to me at dinner once and said:

<i>"What's with the bear?"<i>
