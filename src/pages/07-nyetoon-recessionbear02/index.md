I started to have fun with Recession Bear. It was like we were exploring. I think i was channeling a sort of "Calvin and Hobbes" kind of thing.

During this period, I lived a block away from the Whole Foods at Lincoln and Rose. It was the an easy target to poke at. I wrote an essay, and then had comics to support it. The essay died with the wordpress hack years ago, but I held on to the comics.
