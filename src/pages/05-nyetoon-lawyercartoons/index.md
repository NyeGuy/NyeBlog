Lawyers are beautiful. Some of my best friends are lawyers.

Did you know that I studied political science at Penn once? And I told at least ...15 people? (and the DJ I think) ...at a frat party, that I was studying law. I'm clearly qualified to draw comics about lawyers.

I have more lawyer comics that I will be uploading here as I find them. 
The one I am thinking of is not on this laptop.

stay tuned. do the thing, with the stuff.
