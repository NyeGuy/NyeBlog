The Adventures of Floyd & Norm

<!-- end -->

I had this idea once. "The Odd Couple meets Doctor Who."
I wrote this idea out so many times. I pitched it. Had two producers sorta, kinda interested in it.

They told me sci-fi was saturated. I made them garbage men for a while to pitch them as a show.
I tried to make a short film about it. Got voices, recorded, storyboarded the whole thing out.

And finally, after no one thought anything of it. I decided to make it into a comic series.

Thing about comic series. You really should market them. yeah... well.
Anyway. Here is Chapter one of Floyd & Norm and the HyperCubical.
