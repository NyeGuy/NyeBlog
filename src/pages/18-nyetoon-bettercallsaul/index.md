Fan art for the show...

<!-- end -->

I had a friend who was a writer on Better Call Saul. He mentioned to me that fans send in comics and they put them up close to the writers room. So, I endeavored to draw my take.

I'm told the comic was posted, and even commented on by Vince Gilligan himself. Or at least it makes for a nice story.
