When I need to scratch the gag comic itch.

## What do you do when you are alone in New York in the wintertime?

I did previs on Men in Black III a few years back and the production flew me to the upper east side of Manhattan. Like 'Madmen' area. I was alone, --- away from Lisa. (We were just dating under a year.) Production was kind of hosed, so we were out early every day. Nice people, just kinda hosed production. 

Thing about New York when it's cold... and there is a bar on every corner... you wind up having ample time to put down a few.  

I didn't watch TV and I had a bunch of time, so after I face timed with Lisa, I drew these little guys with the ties and played video games on the ipad. Luckily the beer also worked. 

Gags are hard, and the sanity index was supposed to be capturing a moment of absurdia. Hey, like life!

Just gonna jump in here. That one you just read - probably one of my favorite ever. I love the timing. Ok, sorry - go ahead.
