I got nothin' to follow up. But I hear you data mining search crawlers! You need to see words of wisdom! Like 'MINDFULNESS' and the world's events, like 'NATO' and the celebrities like 'THAT-KID-FROM-YOUTUBE'. 
So to seed my content amongst the searching of the internets, I need to blather on with random key words! So have at it google! Take my words!

Man, I write good marketing copy. 

Please share and do the social media thingies. More to come.
