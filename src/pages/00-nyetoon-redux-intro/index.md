 Welcome to Nyetoon: The Redux.

<!-- end -->

## Welcome to Nyetoon.net as a static web application. 

Nyetoon.com is dead. 
Please remove from your book marks. Sorry, I do not wish to talk about it. 

The good news is that I've managed to save some of the comics! I've decided to rebuild the content that is left into new ways of showing them off.  

Maybe I'll do some new ones!

I've decided to take control of the content in a static web application, and will update all of the relevant information in the devlog on github. 

### This is an experiment in iterative development

Blending scribbles and github. The pages will change and update. The app will change, the experience will change. New content will come, but the site as a whole will evolve into how I feel the content should best be displayed from a user experience perspective.  

I don't know how much I'll put in. I don't know quite how I will edit this. Should be fun, and agonizing. 

I'd love it if you could come along as I figure this out. 
Im on FB, Twitter and instagram -
[@nyetoon](http://twitter.com/nyetoon/) of course.

thx, have fun.
Nye
